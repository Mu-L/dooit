# Dooit Formatters

## What are formatters?

Formatters are, _simply put_, functions to modify the content you're seeing by default on dooit

For example, by default you see the `due` column values in format DD-MM-YYY but if you'd want to change it, you can use a formatter

Some of the reasons you might use a formatter:

- `styling text`
- `adding extra info`

You can find a [a wide range of formatters](https://dooit-org.github.io/dooit-extras/formatters/description.html) in dooit extras
